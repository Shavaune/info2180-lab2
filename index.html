        <p class="blog">Upgrade from AirPods Pro 1st Gen
            Yes, if you want a substantial improvement in audio quality and drastic improvement in noise cancellation. 
            (Fitment, audio quality, and noise cancellation further improved with some foam tips I got from Foam Masters. 
            Also eliminated the thud noise from each pace when running because the AirPods bounce slightly with the stock silicone tips).
            No, if you simply don’t need the latest and greatest. The 1st and 2nd Gen AirPods Pros are identical in dimensions, 
            but they now have a XS sized ear tip

        <p class="blog">Thanks to the efficiency of the M2 chip, MacBook Air can deliver amazing performance without a fan — so it stays completely silent 
            no matter how intense the task.The M2 chip starts the next generation of Apple silicon, with even more of the speed and power efficiency 
            of M1. So you can get more done faster with a more powerful 8‑core CPU. Create captivating images and animations with up to a 10-core GPU. 
            Work with more streams of 4K and 8K ProRes video with the high‑performance media engine. And keep working — or playing — all day and into 
            the night with up to 18 hours of battery life.

        <p class="blog">Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl. Everyone who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, 
            who did not know what to give the child next. Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet. Because it suited her so well, 
            and she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Cap.
            One day her mother said to her, "Come Little Red Cap. Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. 
            She is sick and weak, and they will do her well.lived out in the woods, a half hour from the village. 
        </p>
        <p class="blog">Little Red Cap had run after flowers, and did not continue on her way to grandmother's until she had gathered all that
             she could carry. When she arrived, she found, to her surprise, that the door was open. She walked into the parlor, and everything 
             looked so strange that she thought, "Oh, my God, why am I so afraid? I usually like it at grandmother's." Then she went to the bed 
             and pulled back the curtains. Grandmother was lying there with her cap pulled down over her face and looking very strange. be seen.
